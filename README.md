## 🚀 *Project Title*

*Flight Management System in C*

---

## 📌 *Abstract*

The Flight Management System is a console-based application developed in the C programming language to efficiently manage essential flight-related operations. The program allows administrators to add, view, search, and manage flight details, including flight number, destination, departure time, and seat availability. It simulates a basic airline management workflow where users can handle flight information without the need for a graphical interface or database connectivity.
This project demonstrates structured programming using functions, arrays/structures, file handling (optional), input validation, and menu-driven logic.

| Feature                        | Description                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✈ Add New Flight Details       | Manually insert new flight information (flight number, name, destination, time, seats). |
| 📄 View All Flights            | Display stored flight records in a clean tabular format.                                |
| 🔍 Search Flight               | Search flights by flight number or destination.                                         |
| 🪑 Seat Booking / Cancellation | Reserve or cancel passenger seats (if included in code).                                |
| 🗑 Delete Flight (optional)    | Remove selected flight record from system.                                              |
| 💾 File Storage (optional)     | Flights can be saved and retrieved from a .txt file for persistence.                  |
| 🔐 Input Validation            | Ensures valid flight numbers, time format, and numeric seat count.                      |
| 🧭 Menu-Driven Navigation      | Simple, user-friendly terminal menus keep workflow organized.                           |
