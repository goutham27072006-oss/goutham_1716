## 📌 *Abstract*

The Flight Management System is a console-based application developed in the C programming language to efficiently manage essential flight-related operations. The program allows administrators to add, view, search, and manage flight details, including flight number, destination, departure time, and seat availability. It simulates a basic airline management workflow where users can handle flight information without the need for a graphical interface or database connectivity.
This project demonstrates structured programming using functions, arrays/structures, file handling (optional), input validation, and menu-driven logic.
